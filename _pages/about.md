I am a research engineer working for an industrial company in Japan.

I am interested in how algorithms can enable machines to help human in real-world settings.
Recently, I have been researching following topics:
- learning from human demonstrations, including inverse RL
- how human learns and generalizes different environements (model-based RL)
- generating dynamically smooth trajectories for unknown dynamics system

Previously, I researched in the area of mechanical and aerospace engineering.
Please check [portfolio](/portfolio/) pages, where I summarized some robots and artificial satellites I developed.

Sorry currently some pages are written only in Japanese.
